This file is a README file.

It contains important information about the project.

Please read it carefully.

Thank you!

This system requires a data set to function properly. I will include a link to download the data set below.

The data set must be named "beer_reviews.csv" and placed in the "Data" folder in the root directory of the project.

This program was built in Python 3.13, and I cannot guarantee that it will work in other versions of Python.'

To use this program, you will need to install the following libraries:
- pandas
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip.

To use the program, simply run the beerbot.py file.

From there, you will have a search bar that you can use to search for beers.

Once you click on the search button, you will be given a list of beers that match your search query.

I would recommend searching online to find more information about the recommended beers, and to find out where you can purchase them.

Enjoy!
